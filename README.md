# Study Script
This is a study script that I whipped up kinda quickly and I found it to be good practice for CSSE220 design princples.
I am sharing this script with the public because my friends found it kind-of helpful and I think that that's enough reason to share it.
I may or may not update this, but any contributions would be greatly appreciated if you would like to improve this. :)
